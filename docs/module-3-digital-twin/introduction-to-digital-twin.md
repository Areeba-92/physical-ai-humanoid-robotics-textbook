# Module 3: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Introduction

Digital Twins play a central role in modern Physical AI and humanoid robotics. A Digital Twin is a high-fidelity virtual representation of a physical robot, its sensors, actuators, and operating environment. This virtual counterpart enables safe, scalable, and cost-effective development of intelligent robotic systems.

## Why Digital Twins Matter

Before deploying robots in the real world, developers must validate perception, planning, and control algorithms under diverse conditions. Digital Twins allow extensive testing without risking hardware damage or safety incidents.

## Simulation Platforms

### Gazebo

Gazebo is a robotics-focused simulator that provides accurate physics modeling, realistic sensor simulation, and deep integration with ROS 2. It is widely used for navigation, manipulation, and control algorithm validation.

### Unity

Unity offers high-quality rendering, interactive environments, and advanced visualization capabilities. It is particularly effective for human–robot interaction, synthetic data generation, and immersive simulation.

## Digital Twins in Physical AI

By combining Gazebo or Unity with AI models, robots can be trained, evaluated, and optimized in simulation before being transferred to real hardware. This sim-to-real workflow is essential for scalable and reliable Physical AI systems.
